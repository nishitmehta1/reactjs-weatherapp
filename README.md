## Test
https://nishitmehta1.github.io/reactjs-weatherapp/

NOTE: Since an API is being called for retrieving weather data, you need to allow your browser to make 3rd party requests. 


## What I learnt from this project
* Asynchronous API calling in React
* Parsing data retrieved through API using JSON
* Sending and Receiving props to and from components

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
This will open a Tab on your default Web Browser where the Application will be run.
